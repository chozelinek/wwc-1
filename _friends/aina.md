About me
===========

I am an LCT student. My background is mainly Linguistics.


I'd like to learn
--------------------

I am interested in learning anything that is new for me.
The only thing that was mentioned and I know a bit about are Regular Expressions
and I still don't feel completely confindent with them, so it looks like I am
going to learn a lot :D

I could teach ...
--------------------

Not much yet, as I started programming recently. I am a beginner in everything.
