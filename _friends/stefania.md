About me
===========

I'm Stefania, PostDoc in the SFB-Project B1, where we inspect diachronic change
in English scientific writing with information-theoretic measures. I'm mostly
interested in using new methodologies of data inspection and evaluation for
linguistic analyses.

I'd like to learn
--------------------

More on any methodologies that might be useful for linguistic analysis.

I could teach ...
--------------------

1. Classification with Weka (just basics)
2. Information-theoretic measures to detect typical features across classes
(e.g. time periods, registers)
