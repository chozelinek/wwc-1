title: Keeping your fork up to date

Great work today, gang!

We mentioned briefly how you might go about keeping your repostory fork up to date with the `master`. I'm putting in a blog entry for posterity.

After you're in the *Shell Terminal*, change into your directory with `cd wwc`. Then, you need to do is add the `upstream` for your fork:

```shell
git remote add upstream git@github.com:wowico/wwc.git
```

Now, get the contents of `upstream`:

```shell
# here is master, but there's also gh-pages
git fetch upstream
git checkout master
```
and merge it:

```shell
git merge upstream/master
```

Easy!
