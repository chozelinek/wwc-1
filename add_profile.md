title: Adding your bio

By the end of the first lesson, we want you to have submitted a *pull request*, which will add some information about you to this site. You'll already have forked our repository, so what you'll need to do is:

1. Checkout the `gh-pages` branch
2. Create a markdown file containing a short bio
3. Add the changes to your fork
4. Request that the changes be merged into the main repository.

So, from the *Shell Terminal*:

```shell
# go to fork
cd wwc
# select the website, not the lessons
git checkout gh-pages
```

Now, you can duplicate the template file:

```shell
# take a look at the template
cat _friends/friend.md
# copy it 
cp _friends/friend.md _friends/<yourname>.md
```

Once you've created it, go back to the *Jupyter Notebook*, open it up, and edit it to your liking.

When you're done, you need to upload your local changes to your remote fork:

```shell
# look at changed files
git status
# stage your file
git add _friends/<name>.md
# commit the changes
git commit -m "add my bio to the website"
```

Problem? You'll probably need to register yourself:

```shell
git config --global user.name "Firstname Lastname"
git config --global user.email username@gmail.com
```

... and, you'll need to make an ssh key (sorry!)

```shell
# generate key (defaults are fine)
ssh-keygen
# run agent in background
eval "$(ssh-agent -s)"
# add key
ssh-add ~/.ssh/id_rsa
# show the key so you can copy it
cat ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub
```

Now, you need to copy that key and [add it to your GitHub account](https://help.github.com/articles/adding-a-new-ssh-key-to-your-github-account).

Try again:

```shell
# test your ssh
ssh -T git@github.com
# commit and push to gh-pages
git commit -m "add my bio to the website"
git push origin gh-pages
```

Now, you can go to your fork on GitHub and make a pull request (and forget all about `ssh` for a while.)
