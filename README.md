# Working With Corpora

This repository contains teaching materials for Saarland Uni's [*Working With Corpora*](http://fedora.clarin-d.uni-saarland.de/unserwiki/doku.php?id=training:working_with_corpora/) program. It's been adapted from the repository for teaching materials and additional resources used by [*Research Platforms Services*](http://melbourne.resbaz.edu.au/) at the University of Melbourne to teach *Python*, *IPython*, *Jupyter* and the *Natural Language Toolkit* (*NLTK*).

Essentially, the idea of both programs is to run free training in reproducible research methods and tools via [a cloud platform](https://dit4c.github.io/), so that nobody has to worry about installation/operating system/specs problems. All code is written and executed within [Jupyter Notebooks](http://jupyter.org/), allowing easy access to earlier input and output, as well as the rich display of text/images.

All the materials used in the workshops are in this repository. In fact, cloning this repository will be our first activity together as a group. To do that, just open your terminal and type/paste:

```shell
git clone git@github.com:wowico/wwc.git
```

Problem? You'll probably need to register yourself:

```shell
git config --global user.name "Firstname Lastname"
git config --global user.email username@gmail.com
```
... and, you'll need to make an ssh key (sorry!)

```shell
# generate key (defaults are fine)
ssh-keygen
# run agent in background
eval "$(ssh-agent -s)"
# add key
ssh-add ~/.ssh/id_rsa
# show the key so you can copy it
cat ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub
```

Now, you need to copy that key and [add it to your GitHub account](https://help.github.com/articles/adding-a-new-ssh-key-to-your-github-account).

Try again:

```shell
# test your ssh
ssh -T git@github.com
git clone git@github.com:wowico/wwc.git
```

Great!

## Configuring our Notebooks

Our lessons are stored as *markdown* files. The following line of code will let us open *markdown* files in the *Jupyter Notebook*.

```shell
pip install notedown
printf "c.NotebookApp.contents_manager_class = 'notedown.NotedownContentsManager'\n" >> ~/.jupyter/jupyter_notebook_config.py
```
